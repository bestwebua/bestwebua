## My principles

> *"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live." - John F. Woods*

I take to code quality very seriously. It doesn't matter to me if it's closed commercial code or Open Source code. It should still be well written, have 100% test coverage and be documented as well. For case when I can choose between speed and **quality** of code I'll choose the second one.

## Open Source

I've been actively working on Open Source Software for over 3 years, while having a full-time job at the same time. During this time I have created [`truemail-rb`](https://truemail-rb.org) and [`mocktools`](https://github.com/mocktools) organizations to organize these code. Here is the short list of the projects that I have created and currently maintaining on. Many of them have been mentioned on [Awesome Ruby](https://awesome-ruby.com), [Awesome Go](https://awesome-go.com) and repeatedly announced on [RubyWeekly](https://rubyweekly.com) digest.
